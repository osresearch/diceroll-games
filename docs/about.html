<h1>Cryptographic Dice?</h1>

<img src="images/d6.png" />

<p>

This site allows you to secretly roll dice with your untrusted enemies
in a way that should ensure that no set of the players can influence
the outcome.  Even if all of the other players are colluding,
as long as there is one honest player, then the results should be
fair.  The server is also untrusted and not involved
other than routing messages between the players,
who establish a group session key using Diffie-Hellman so that
they can have end-to-end encryption of the actual dice rolls.

The players have four verification words that can be used out-of-band
to verify that their actual public key was used to establish the session
key, which protects against the server or a MITM attempting to
sneak in a fake key for a player.

<h2>Flipping coins over the phone</h2>
<img src="images/coin.png" />
To understand how it works, consider a thought experiment of how you
would flip a coin with an unscrupulous person on the phone.  You can't
trust them to flip the coin and tell you the result.  Likewise they
don't trust you to flip the coin.

<p>You could both flip a coin and have
a rule that if the two coins are the same then it is a Heads, and if the
two coins are different then the result is a Tails.  This is fair, 50%
of the time the coins will be the same and 50% of the time they will be
different, except that now the issue is who says their result first?
If you say you have a Heads, they can lie about their coin and
effectively determine the result of the coin flip.

<p>So what is necessary is a way to commit to the value of your coin
flip, without revealing the actual value.  One-way cryptographic hash
functions are perfect for this, with a minor caveat -- if you were to
publish just <em>Hash("Heads")</em> or <em>Hash("Tails")</em>, then
your opponent can precompute both of them to see which you have sent.
Instead of hashing just <em>"Heads"</em> or <em>"Tails"</em>, each
of you hash a large cryptographicly secure random number.  And then
the bottom bit of the random number is used to determine your coin flip:
0 is Tails, 1 is Heads.  The bottom bit of your number and their number
are XOR'ed and the result is used to determine the final coin flip.
Now it doesn't matter who reveals first since
the other party can't change their result.

<p>(Another approach is that if you have exchanged public keys with your
enemies, you could sign your coin flip (along with some random padding as
before to ensure they can't guess it) and send just the signature first.
Then both of you reveal the padding and the coin flip, and can verify
each other's signatures, although this requires more math and key management
than the simple XOR and hash)

<p>
The nice thing about this cryptographic coin flip techinque is that
it generalizes to an arbitrary number of people on the phone call.
Even if the rest of them collude to come up with random numbers that XOR
to their desired value, they don't know if your random number will flip
that result or not.

<h2>What if we want to keep the results secret?</h2>
With the XOR technique the server and anyone watching the clear-text
traffic can learn the value of the coin flip.  The actual traffic is
encrypted with TLS, so it is harder to for anyone outside the server
to see, but the server could still learn the result.  Instead we 
we use Diffie-Hellman to generate a shared secret for all of the peers
player and use it to protect all of the communication.
This algorithm <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diffie%E2%80%93Hellman_key_exchange#Operation_with_more_than_two_parties">generalizes for arbitrary number of players</a>, with some additional math and a way to agree on an
ordering of the players.  The worst case is the server can prevent
key agreement, but that doesn't sacrifice the security of the system.

<p>
This way no outside party can determine what the result is for our coin flip,
not even if they have code execution on the server.  They can try to sneak
a fake player into the round, but you can use an out-of-band channel (like
your voice chat) to verify the public portion of each player's Diffie-Hellman
key.  If the four words don't match, then something has tried to MITM
the group key establishment.

<h2>Now can we trust the server?</h2>
The server is never trusted, although there are a few more steps required to fix this. We'll need to import
the public key management from <a href="https://secret.cards">secret.cards</a>
to allow players to sign their commitments, and a way for players to
establish identity out-of-band.

<h3>Adding new dice sets?</h3>
You can checkout the <a href="https://github.com/osresearch/diceroll-games/">source code</a>
and add new dice to the <em>docs/dice.json</em> file.  Eventually there
should be a drag-and-drop way to add new images and sets.
