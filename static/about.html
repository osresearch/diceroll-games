This site allows you to roll dice with your untrusted enemies
in a way that should ensure that no set of the players can influence
the outcome.  Even if all of the other players are colluding,
as long as there is one honest player, then the results should be
fair.  The server is also necessarily not trusted and not involved
other than routing messages between the players.

<h2>Flipping coins over the phone</h2>
To understand how it works, consider a thought experiment of how you
would flip a coin with an unscrupulous person on the phone.  You can't
trust them to flip the coin and tell you the result.  Likewise they
don't trust you to flip the coin.

<p>You could both flip a coin and have
a rule that if the two coins are the same then it is a Heads, and if the
two coins are different then the result is a Tails.  This is fair, 50%
of the time the coins will be the same and 50% of the time they will be
different, except that now the issue is who says their result first?
If you say you have a Heads, they can lie about their coin and
effectively determine the result of the coin flip.

<p>So what is necessary is a way to commit to the value of your coin
flip, without revealing the actual value.  One-way cryptographic hash
functions are perfect for this, with a minor caveat -- if you were to
publish just <em>Hash("Heads")</em> or <em>Hash("Tails")</em>, then
your opponent can precompute both of them to see which you have sent.
Instead of hashing just <em>"Heads"</em> or <em>"Tails"</em>, each
of you hash a large cryptographicly secure random number.  And then
the bottom bit of the random number is used to determine your coin flip:
0 is Tails, 1 is Heads.  The bottom bit of your number and their number
are XOR'ed and the result is used to determine the final coin flip.
Now it doesn't matter who reveals first since
the other party can't change their result.

<p>(Another approach is that if you have exchanged public keys with your
enemies, you could sign your coin flip (along with some random padding as
before to ensure they can't guess it) and send just the signature first.
Then both of you reveal the padding and the coin flip, and can verify
each other's signatures.)

<p>
The nice thing about this cryptographic coin flip techinque is that
it generalizes to an arbitrary number of people on the phone call.
Even if the rest of them collude to come up with random numbers that XOR
to their desired value, they don't know if your random number will flip
that result or not.

<h2>What if we want to keep the results secret?</h2>
With the XOR technique the server and anyone watching the clear-text
traffic can learn the value of the coin flip.  The actual traffic is
encrypted with TLS, so it is harder to for anyone outside the server
to see, but the server still learns the result.  As an extension,
rather than committing to <em>Hash(X)</em>, instead we use Diffie-Hellman
and commit to <em>Hash(X=G^x % p)</em> while our opponent can send us
<em>Hash(Y=G^y % p)</em>.  After revealing our values, we can both
then compute <em>(G^x % p)^y = G^(x+y) % p</em> and use that for
our random value.  Again, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diffie%E2%80%93Hellman_key_exchange#Operation_with_more_than_two_parties">this generalizes for arbitrary number of players</a>,
with some need to establish ordering, and is a todo item.
This way no outside party can determine what the result is for our coin flip.

<h2>Now can we trust the server?</h2>
No, and there are a few more steps required to fix this. We'll need to import
the public key management from <a href="https://secret.cards">secret.cards</a>
to allow players to sign their commitments, and a way for players to
establish identity out-of-band.
